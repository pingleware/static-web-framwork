Simple Static Web Framework
==============
Simple PHP static web framework. All pages are routed through the index.php page setting the GET['page'] variable to different pages to allow multiple pages. 


Features
--------------
- The entire project has an APPVARS file that contains global information 
- Each page has an associated config file named "controller-foo.php" that contains page title, description, css/js to include, optional headers and footers.
- Each page can but doesn't need to have an associated model that can define various aspects of a potential object. However, since this is meant to be a mostly static framework it can be ignored. 
- Set up with GRUNT to allow automatic LESS compiling/watching by running the CLI command grunt in the project directory

Upcoming Features 
--------------
- Create scripts to automatically create associated config files with each page and automatically fill out the required variables.
- Create a script that converts to completely static website. This should render pure HTML/JS pages with no PHP.
